## Testing
### Test framework: Mocha
**Mocha** is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. 

### Assertion Library: Chai
**Chai** is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

### Helper Libraries:
#### JSDOM
**JSDOM** is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

## Continuous Integration
