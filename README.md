Starter for JavaScript projects.

## Package Manager
### NPM
**NPM** is the package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry.

## Web Server
### Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

## Automation
### NPM Scripts
Spm supports the "scripts" property of the package.json file, for the following scripts: pre/post install, pre/post start, pre/post stop and many more.

## Transpiling
### Babel
Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through syntax transformers. Babel allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support.

## Bundling
### WebPack
Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

## Lint
### ESLint
ESLint is an open source project originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Its goal is to provide a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript.

## Testing
### Test framework: Mocha
**Mocha** is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. 

### Assertion Library: Chai
**Chai** is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

### Helper Libraries:
#### JSDOM
**JSDOM** is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

## Continuous Integration

On Travis CI we can check if our application works fine on Linux/Mac environment. Using AppVeryor we make sure our application works on Windows.

### Travis CI (Linux/Mac Environment)

### Mock HTTP
#### JSON Schema Faker: 
 - faker.js, 
 - change.js, 
 - randexp.js
 
#### JSON Server
Full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously)
Created with <3 for front-end developers who need a quick back-end for prototyping and mocking.

### Error login
#### Track.js
